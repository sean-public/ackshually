# ackshually: Wikipedia Citation Scraper and Fact Checker

`ackshually` is a Python script that fetches random English Wikipedia articles, scrapes their inline citations, and then fact-checks them using an LLM by scraping the provided URLs for each citation. It helps verify if the given reference content supports the citation.

## Installation and Running

To run this script, you need to have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.
You'll also require an instance of [Ollama](https://ollama.io) running somewhere for the LLM functionality.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have a running Ollama server accessible from your machine.
2. Install the project dependencies with `poetry install`.
3. Run the script with `poetry run ./ackshually.py`.
4. The script will fetch a random Wikipedia article, scrape citations, and for each citation:
   - Scrape the content of the referenced URL.
   - Use the LLM to determine if the reference supports the citation and explain its decision.

## What model is best to use?

I use [Command-R](https://ollama.com/library/command-r) on Ollama by running `ollama pull command-r` ahead of time. This works well on GPUs with â‰¥24GB and the model is excellent at following instructions, finding citations, RAG, and emitting JSON. There are many others to choose from, just update the `model` sent to `client.generate()` by hand.
